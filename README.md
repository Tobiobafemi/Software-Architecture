#Share Price Comparison Web Application
Overview

This project is a Java-based Share Price Comparison application developed for the Software Architecture module.

The system retrieves and compares stock market data for multiple companies using a layered architectural design to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns.

#Architecture

The application follows a Layered Architecture Pattern, consisting of:

Controller Layer – Handles user interaction and request flow

Service Layer – Contains business logic for processing and comparing share prices

Data Provider Layer – Retrieves stock market data

Domain Layer – Defines core data models

This structure improves scalability, readability, and testability.
